# GADSLeaderboard_FINAL
GADS Leaderboard practice project implementing JSON, Retrofit, RecyclerView, and multiple activities.

At this point the project is incomplete but I will continue to work on it until I have all the activities working.
Required: Parsing JSON to app -> The parsing works when I choose to see it on an empty screen, my issue was with populating the cards in the recycler view.
Required: Getting Popups to appear -> Once again works in a single activity app, but the communication between classes led me to null pointers.
Required: Posting through the app -> I was able to complete all of the required code but I was unable to complete the post due to the failure of the popup fragments.
